The number of IDs returned is not guaranteed to be 5000 as suspended users are filtered out after connections are queried. If no cursor is provided, a value of -1 will be assumed, which is the first "page". The response from the API will include a previous_cursor and next_cursor to allow paging back and forth. See Using cursors to navigate collections for more information.</para>
        /// <para><paramref name="int count (optional)"/> : Specifies the number of IDs attempt retrieval of, up to a maximum of 5,000 per distinct request. The value of count is best thought of as a limit to the number of results to return. When using the count parameter with this method, it is wise to use a consistent count value across all requests to the same user's collection. Usage of this parameter is encouraged in environments where all 5,000 IDs constitutes too large of a response.</para>
